What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?
We were trying different sorting algorithms and data structures to find the pros and cons of each. A general goal with this is to optimize run time and system resources to use as little as possible. Each method has their own use case depending on what you are trying to achieve while sorting, searching, and storing.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.
We had several projects involving each data structure, giving us an overview to each. The different data structures are important to understand as they work differently from each other, so depending on what you are trying to achieve, there may be one that is better than the others. Hashtables can be very fast at searching, while trees are always organized etc. understanding each one allows you to recognize when and where each should be used.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?
When I reach a roadblock, I end up searching around online for people that were having similar problems. If that doesn't help me I will leave it alone for a little bit and come back later to see if I had any revelations on my issue.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?
This project helped expand my knowledge on data structures, and the more technical aspect of optimizing your programming. Making a less intense program was always something on the horizon for me, as opposed to just making it work. This project has made these ideas more accessable and allows me to execute them better for future projects.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
I always seek to improve my commenting and readability. I always try to imagine what someone who didn't write the program would think when they see what I wrote, so I seek to explain with comments and add whitespace and indentations to clarify what and how my code does.
